I always liked coding and it was a great hobby but I actually went for 'Biomedical Engineering' when it was time to go to university.\nAnd I don't regret it! It was a fun time and I enjoyed all the things taught there. But soon after taking my first steps in typical Biomedical Engineering jobs, it was very clear to me that I had to go back to coding. And that's what I did.\nActually, I always worked as a freelancer on side jobs whilst I was at university. And I also started teaching others there. I like sharing my knowledge and I really believe that we all should do our best to allow everyone to learn new things and achieve his or her goals.\nNow, I've taught about 200,000 students worldwide.\nI published dozens of courses and I got all those tutorials you find on this page.

This Python course was excellent for those that cringe at the thought of starting over from scratch with attempts to write programs once again. Python is a great building language for any beginner programmer. Thank you Avi!</li><br/><li>I had no idea about any programming language. With Avi's lectures, I'm now aware of several python concepts and I'm beginning to write my own programs. Avi is crisp and clear in his lectures and it is easy to catch the concepts and the depth of it through his explanations. Thanks, Avi for the wonderful course, You're awesome! It's helping me a lot :)</li><br/><li>Videos are short and concise and well-defined in their title, this makes them easy to refer back to when a refresher is needed. Explanations aren't convoluted with complicated examples, which adds to the quick pace of the videos. I am very pleased with the decision to enroll in this course.
